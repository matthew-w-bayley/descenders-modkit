# Descenders Competitive Live Racing Guidelines
Each and every rule is subject to change at any time. Each and **every rule is subject to the discretion of the judges**.

## Penalties

### Boundaries
- A **penalty will be applied** if a boundary violation:
    - Is deemed to be time saving
    - Is deemed to intentionally save time

Otherwise, no penalty will be applied.

### Respawns

- A **penalty will be applied** if a respawn:
    - Is deemed to be time saving
        - e.g. respawning to avoid an obstacle, respawning to significantly decrease speed riding into a berm, etc.
    - Is deemed unnecessary

Otherwise, no penalty will be applied.

Note: A respawn is not time saving if it is saving 'lost' time (that is, time that has been lost due to a mistake).

### Main line features
Where a main line feature is avoided, the run will be disqualified.

### Appeals
Due to imperfect player syncing, judges may see the gameplay differently to you - because of this, replays should be stored in the Descenders Modkit times database, these will be used as reference for appeals.

If you believe a penalty has been applied unfairly, you may appeal the decision. Please contact a judge and provide the penalty you believe was applied unfairly, and the reason why you believe it was applied unfairly.

## General Rules
- Any kind of cheating is not allowed.
- Any use of macros/scripts is banned.
- No use of speed booster or bike switcher mod.
- No use of game modifiers.

## Rules of Racing
- You should stay within the track limits at all times.
    - Where there is tape, you should stay within it.
    - Where there is no tape, you should stay within the main trail (on most tracks this is indicated by the dirt texture).
    - Where there is no tape and no clear main trail, information will be provided prior to the race.
- Every main line feature should be ridden in your run.
    - 'side hits' are not considered main line features.
    - where the feature is a jump, the takeoff should be ridden.
    - for clarification of what is considered a main line feature, please refer to the course preview.

# Appendix
### Time-Saving
- If your cut has
    - increased speed
    - decreased distance travelled
    - avoided a hazard (e.g. a rock)
    - taken a line that decreases difficulty

or otherwise decreased the time of your run, it is considered time-saving.

### Main Line Features
- +, if a feature has no intended alternate line, it is considered a main line feature.
- A 'side hit' is not considered a main line feature.
