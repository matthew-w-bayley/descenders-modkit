# Descenders Competitive Live Racing Guidelines
Each and every rule is subject to change at any time. Each and **every rule is subject to the discretion of the judges**.

## Boundaries
- A **penalty will be applied** if a boundary violation:
    - Is deemed to be time saving
    - Is deemed intentional

Otherwise, no penalty will be applied.

## Respawns

- A **penalty will be applied** if a respawn:
    - Is deemed to be time saving
        - e.g. respawning to avoid an obstacle, respawning to significantly decrease speed riding into a berm, etc.
    - Is deemed unnecessary

Otherwise, no penalty will be applied.

Note: A run is not time saving if it is saving 'lost' time (that is, time that has been lost due to a mistake).

## Appeals
Due to imperfect player syncing, judges may see the gameplay differently to you - because of this, replays should be stored in the Descenders Modkit times database, these will be used as reference for appeals.

If you believe a penalty has been applied unfairly, you may appeal the decision. Please contact a judge and provide the penalty you believe was applied unfairly, and the reason why you believe it was applied unfairly.

## Penalty Levels
- **Minor** - 5 seconds
- **Major** - 10 seconds
- **Extreme** - 15 seconds

Where rules are blatantly violated and the amount of penalties are considered excessive, the run may be **disqualified**.

# Appendix
### Time-Saving
If your cut has sped you up, shortened the distance to the next checkpoint, avoided an obstacle, or otherwise decreased the time of your run, it is considered time-saving.
