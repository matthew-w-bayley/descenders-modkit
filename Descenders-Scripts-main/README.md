# Descenders Scripts

Here is a compilation of Scripts I have made for the game [Descenders](https://www.descendersgame.com/), you can find tutorials for each sub-section [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbSWJGFbqy4v2UPe9dX7EOev3M4_8U88Q).

Take a look at them all!

## Ban Handler
### Description
The Descenders Ban Handler is primarily designed with intent to prevent '[cracked clients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_cracking)' from accessing a Descenders map.
## Map and Teleporter
### Description
Features. This is the only mapping system in Descenders capable of tracking you, and all other players that have joined your game.
## Time Servers
### Description
This system is designed to get the time of a user on a particular track. What makes this system different to any other is the live updating leaderboard it provides in the mod.
## Tombstones
### Description
If you've ever seen a race track, you will know there are particular sections that cause complications - if your map isn't ever involved in any competition - how are you to know how people are playing it? What they enjoy? What's going on?

Here's your answer - tombstones, to see the occurences of deaths on a map, for both the creator, and the user.
